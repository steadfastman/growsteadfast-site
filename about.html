      <h1>My Story: From Burnout to a Biblical Foundation</h1>
      <p>Years ago, I hit a wall. I was busy, “successful,” and exhausted. I was drifting—reacting to life instead of leading with conviction. The turning point came when I submitted my definition of manhood to Scripture. I stopped chasing quick fixes and started building habits of prayer, humility, and courageous leadership. God transformed me—from the inside out.</p>
      <p>Now I coach men to build that same foundation. Not to become louder or tougher for its own sake, but to become steadfast: anchored, responsible, sacrificial, and strong.</p>
      <h2>What is a Steadfast Man?</h2>
      <p>A steadfast man is not perfect, but he is anchored. He rejects passivity and accepts responsibility. He leads with courage, loves sacrificially, and builds a legacy that honors God.</p>
      <blockquote><em>“Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.”</em> — 1 Corinthians 16:13</blockquote>
